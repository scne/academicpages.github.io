title: "On fast prototyping LoRaWAN: a cheap and open platform for daily experiments"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/prototyping_lorawan
excerpt: 'Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) are gaining momentum within Internet of Things 
          (IoT) circles, thanks to their inherent capabilities to simplify network topologies and increase 
          coverage in low rate low power communications. This manuscript focuses on a specific 
          LPWAN technology, namely Long Range Wireless Area Network (LoRaWAN), which is 
          being widely investigated by the research community worldwide. LoRaWAN offers many 
          noticeable features, including: wide coverage areas, security by design, power consumption 
          and bandwidth optimization, and a high degree of flexibility and reconfigurability.'
