title: "Four Key Factors to Design a Web of Things Architecture"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/four_key_factors
excerpt: 'The spreading of Internet accesses and latest developments of Web technologies simplified 
          the process of building architectures capable of collecting and sharing data. On the other 
          side, a massive use of smart devices helped increasing the overall quality of the monitored 
          process. This report illustrates how sensed raw data collected over an electrical plant by a 
          smart device have been turned into a market valuable knowledge. Implementing and 
          extending the Back-end Data Sharing Pattern, the proposed architecture underlines some 
          key factors to be appointed when designing this kind of infrastructures and how they have 
          been implemented in a real world use case.'
